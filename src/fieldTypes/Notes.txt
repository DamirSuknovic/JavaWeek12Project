Static methods ---> can be called with className and belongs to the class
                    can be called without creating and OBJECT (this is static method benefit)

Especially at testing we will create UTILITY classes. In these classes our methods will be all static methods

Static vs Instance
1. Instance method can be called only by the Object name
2. Static methods CAN NOT reach non-static fields (instance)
4. from static method we can not call instance variables HOWEVER, we can call static field from an instance method
